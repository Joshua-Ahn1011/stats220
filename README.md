# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Biological Sciences
  It is my second year Of university
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in coding and imaginative solutions to AI
  - Also it's my first time coding and I love to learn about it 
- I am interested in learning about how coding is used in modern society and its basics.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![]()
I am going to kill 
# I just lost all of my progress
## I am going to take it out on this project now
### Feel my the wrath of a thousand exploding suns
**My old project was all about chicken for some reason**
_But now it shall be about rage_
