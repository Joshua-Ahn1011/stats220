# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Biological Sciences
  It is my second year Of university
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am interested in coding and imaginative solutions to AI
  - Also it's my first time coding and I love to learn about it 
- I am interested in learning about how coding is used in modern society and its basics.
  - Wanting to perhaps learn the basics of developing simple games

In order of what I want to learn would be:
1. The underlying basics of R to read a new language
2. How a script can make a website or game
3. How to automate menial tasks such as excel in a business context

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![image]("media3.giphy.com/media/aUovxH8Vf9qDu/giphy.gif")
I am going to kill 
# I just lost all of my progress
## I am going to take it out on this project now
### Feel my the wrath of a thousand exploding suns
**My old project was all about chicken for some reason**
_But now it shall be about rage_
